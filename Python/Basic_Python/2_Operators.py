# Python day_1
# Data Types - Primitive data type are integer, float, boolean, string
# Variables - are storage/container to store the values
# mutable vs immutable data types

# Operators
# Airthmatic operators

a = 10            # = is our assignment operator, assign the value from right hand side to left hand side
b = 20.88
c = 7

result = a + b    # sum or addition of two variables
print(result)

result = a - c    # subtraction of two variables
print(result)

result = a * c    # multiplication of two variables
print(result)

result = 15 % 2   # modulus operator - get the remainder
print(result)

print(15 / 3)        # division
print(15 / 2)        # division

result = a // c      # floor division or integer division
print(result)

result = 25 // 7      # floor division or integer division
print(result)

result = 2 ** 4      # exponentiation (here power of 2 is 4)
print(result)


result = 2*2*2*2      # explanation for exponentiation 
print(result)


result = a + c * 4 - 5 * 2 + 3 * 3
print(result)

result = (a + c) * 4 - 5 * (2 + 3) * 3         # 17 * 4 - 5 * 5 * 3
